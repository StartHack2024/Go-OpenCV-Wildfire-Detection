# Go/OpenCV Wildfire Detection

This README provides instructions on how to run the `main.go` and `opencv.py` files included in this project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the files, make sure you have the following installed:
- Go
- Python
- OpenCV for Python

You can check if you have Go and Python installed by running `go version` and `python --version` in your terminal, respectively.

For OpenCV, you can install it via pip:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy requests tensorflow geocoder pytz
```

## Running `main.go`

To run the `main.go` file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.go`.
3. Run the file using the command:

```
go run main.go
```

This will compile and execute the Go program defined in `main.go`.

## Running `opencv.py`

To run the `opencv.py` file, you must have Python and OpenCV installed. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `opencv.py`.
3. Run the file using the command:

```
python opencv.py
```

This will execute the Python script, which utilizes OpenCV for various operations such as image processing.
